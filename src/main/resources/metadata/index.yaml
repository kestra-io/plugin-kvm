description: "Manage KVM virtual machines using the Libvirt API."
body: "Use these tasks to define, start, stop, and delete virtual machines, update configurations, and list active or inactive domains directly from Kestra workflows. They require access to a libvirtd daemon (via local socket, SSH, or TLS) and accept task-specific settings such as XML definitions, power-state flags, and resource cleanup options for persistent storage. The included trigger allows for automated responses to VM lifecycle events, such as state transitions or unexpected shutdowns."
